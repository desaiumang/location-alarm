This project was first copied from CodingWithMitch and reused to complete my semester project requirements.
<p>This android app can be used by frequent travelers who wish to get notified when they are at a certain distance from their destination. By selecting their destination and radius, when the user is at a desired distance the alarm will ring once and the phone vibrates.<br>To stop the alarm and vibration simply minimize the app or destroy it or change the destination location.</p>
<p>Further work will include, <ul><li>Implement service to ensure proper working in background.</li><li>Optimization for lower battery usage.</li> <li>Remembering previous destinations.</li> <li>Preview current point to point distance between user and destination.</li></ul></p>
<p>Here are some screenshots of my work.</p>
